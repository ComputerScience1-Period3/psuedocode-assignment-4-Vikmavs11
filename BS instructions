BS- Vikram Basude

Deal the cards out evenly. If there are remainders, place them face down in the center of the table as the beginning of the discard pile.
Play begins with the player to the left of the dealer. He places the Aces in his hand facedown on the discard pile and announces his play
to the table: "One Ace." If the player does not have any Aces, or if he wishes to get rid of more than one card, he
may bluff and play non-Ace cards while announcing: "Two Aces." The next player plays 2s, the next player plays 3s, and so on. If a player 
doesn't believe an announcement, he can call out, "BS!" The person who played the cards must turn them over and show the challenger whether he is bluffing or not. A player who is caught bluffing must pick up the entire discard pile and add it to his hand. If a challenged player is not bluffing, then
the challenger must pick up the discard pile. When the rank to play reaches Kings, it then goes back to Aces and the numbers start again.
